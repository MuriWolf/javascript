// In the code you wrote for Task 3, the greeting() method is defined twice, once for each cat. This isn't ideal (specifically, it violates a principle in programming sometimes called DRY or "Don't Repeat Yourself").

// In this task we want you to improve the code so greeting() is only defined once, and every cat instance gets its own greeting() method. Hint: you should use a JAVASCRIPT CONSTRUCTOR to create cat instances.
